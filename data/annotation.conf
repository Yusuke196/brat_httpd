# Simple text-based definitions of hierarchial ontologies of
# (physical) entity types, relation types, event types, and
# attributes.

# ACE'05 entity, relation and event definitions
# (http://projects.ldc.upenn.edu/ace/annotation/2005Tasks.html).
# Please edit this according to the needs of your annotation.
